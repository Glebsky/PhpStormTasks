# Description
This plugin will keep track of your daily tasks. A todo-list if you will. Tasks are hierarchical, so it can have subtasks. 
Tasks have a priority and possibly an icon. Time tracking is built-in, so you can see how much time you have spent on one
particular task. 

# Installation
Normally, this plugin would be installed via JetBrains's repository. If you have to install it manually,
either choose "Install from disk" in IDEA's plugins page, or manually place it in

    $userhome/.IntelliJIdea2017/config/plugins/

The file that keeps all the plugins settings is called tasksettings.xml and is found in 

    $userhome/.IntelliJIdea2017/config/options/tasksettings.xml.

The file that holds all the tasks can be found in 

    $userhome/.IntelliJIdea2017/config/options/tasks.xml.
    
So if you could go ahead and back that file up regularly that'd be great. All right!
